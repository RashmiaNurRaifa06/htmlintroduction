    <p>My favorite fruit is watermelon because of its juicy, rich taste.  Watermelon is not only yummy, but it also benefits your health in many ways.  First of all,  it relieves sore muscles.  L- citrulline is the natural juice in the watermelon that soothes the sore muscles.  For example, watermelon is perfect for athletes that get sore after a game.  It would make them feel much better to play more.

        Secondly, watermelon helps fight diseases like heart diseases and cancer.  A powerful antioxidant in the fruit is what would prevent diseases.  For example, if you know someone sick, bring them some watermelon to improve their health.  Lastly, this tasty fruit is rich in minerals and vitamins.  Watermelon is mostly full of vitamin C and vitamin A.  Watermelon also is full of water which means itâ€™s good when you get dehydrated.  Watermelon has its great taste and its healthiness.
