    <p>
        Birds are part of the balance of nearly every ecosystem on the planet. Birds eat insects and plants, and bird eggs are food for may other animals. Fruit-eating birds help spread seeds, and nectar-eating birds pollinate flowers. Birds have long been considered an important part of human culture.
